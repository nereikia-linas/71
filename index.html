                <p>Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence,
                  expressed by the equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his services to Theoretical
                  Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.</p>
